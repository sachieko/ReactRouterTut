# React Router Tutorial

This was a react app built using Vite and bundled with localforage and match-sorter as well as sort-by.

This will follow the lifecycle of building a site through the tutorial for practice, speed, and using typescript.
This is an exercise in using typescript with functions I am previously familiar with in regular javascript.
